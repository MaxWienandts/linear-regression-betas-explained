Deep dive into how to interpret, transform, and validate linear regression coefficients â€” including OLS, robust SEs, and bootstrap inference.

Linear-Regression Betas â€” From Numbers to Meaning
Author: Max Wienandts

Why this notebook?
You already know how to estimate coefficients â€” the full derivations and Python code live in:
- GitHubâ€ƒhttps://github.com/MaxWienandts/Linear_Regression_OLS_vs_Gradient_Descent
- Mediumâ€ƒhttps://medium.com/@maxwienandts/understanding-linear-regression-statistical-vs-machine-learning-approaches-08a5a5b04bbe

This notebook is about turning Î²Ì‚ into insight. We tackle three practical questions for every coefficient:
- What does it mean?â€ƒHow scaling, logging, standardising, or interacting variables changes interpretation.
- How uncertain is it?â€ƒCompare classical OLS, heteroskedasticity-robust (HC1), and bootstrap standard errors side by side.
- Is it statistically relevant?â€ƒSee how t-tests, HC1-robust tests, and bootstrap confidence intervals alter the verdict.

Master these mechanics and you will:
- design experiments and pick units that make coefficients intuitive,
- explain elasticities and marginal effects to non-technical stakeholders,
- keep confidence intervals meaningful after common data transformations.

Key takeaway: A regression coefficient is only as valuable as your grasp of its scale, uncertainty, and context. Letâ€™s make every Î² tell a story you can defend.
